System was designed with CQRS and repository patterns

Used the clean atchitecture concepts

Applicaiton layer is loosely coupled with persistance, identity and infrstructure projects
they can be changed or completly replaced without changing the core business logic
Code is highly testable with mock services
Each operation uses a separate class to keep the code small and maintainable
All the behaviours are grouped by features
with cqrs there is a clear separation in the code read and writes. Idea is to scale the applicaiton
